This is the JavaScript code available for the Livly Island calculator posted on my website here: https://falmer.neocities.org/tools/bug-calculator with the attached HTML as well.
I'm posting this on GitHub both so I can say I did something productive with my eight hours today and in case anyone wants to look at the source code.

The C++ version of the code can be found here: https://onlinegdb.com/-7-t_9Lr0

I have no idea what the licenses mean on this website, but feel free to do whatever you want with the code, so long as you keep any edits open for other people to use.
